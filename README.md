# Rock-Paper-Scissor
This is a best of five match at rock-paper-scissore, where a human (you) plays against a machine (your computer) to save the earth from a dark era where machines rules the world!

This project is part of The Odin Poject foundation course.
The goal is to start playing around with some javascript basics.
